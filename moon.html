        <p>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, circling the planet at an average distance of roughly 385,000 kilometers (239,000 miles). 
            With a diameter of just under 3,500 kilometers (about 2,160 miles), the cratered surface of the rocky object is one of the most recognisable objects in the sky.
